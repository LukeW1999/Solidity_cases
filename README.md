This is new repository to store the test sample of the solidity.

Current they are able to be verified the same assertion of CVL but with solc smt solver. But now the ESBMC cannot.

TODO:
1.verify if they are verifying the same property as certora did and what is the difference between result.

2.Find out how to make the workflow works for ESBMC?: adjust the BMC test framework or ask ESBMC to adjust for Solidity 0.8 json?
